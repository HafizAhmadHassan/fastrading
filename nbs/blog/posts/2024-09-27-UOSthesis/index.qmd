# Predicting Forex Volatility Using Deep Learning

In this paper, we use deep learning techniques to predict the future volatility of Forex currency pairs. The multiscale Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

In this article, we use deep learning methods to solve a real-world problem closely related to trading applications, namely intraday volatility forecasting. Our study shows that the intuition-driven approach combined with the divide-and-conquer approach led by domain knowledge provides great potentials.

Volatility modelling is one of the fundamental problems in the financial world. High-frequency trading algorithms need to predict intraday volatility to make real-time trading decisions, but practitioners often utilise ranges as a proxy of volatility in real trading.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are two popular methods for volatility forecasting. DNN is a common network architecture that takes multivariate features as inputs and feeds them into fully connected layers, while RNNs capture the temporal information of data.

## 1.2 Patterns in the Intraday Ranges

FX ranges exhibit strong patterns, usually explained by economic reasons. Our main goal is to capture these economically linked intuitions in our prediction model.

The FX market is heavily influenced by macroeconomic news and events, and volatility clustering and cross-currency correlations are often observed.

The patterns can be summarised into three main categories: time-based seasonality, intraday auto-correlations, and cross-currency pair correlations.

## 1.3 The Road Map for Deep Learning of FX Ranges

Despite the complexity of the task, neural networks are a perfect candidate for generating range functions in real time. Neural networksâ€™ modular nature allows us to model the three main patterns individually using a divide-and-conquer approach.

## 1.4 The Structure of the Paper

This paper presents a neural network model for range forecasting. It is organised as follows: Section 3 provides an empirical analysis, and Section 4 presents a numerical experiment.

# 2 Data Description

We use the minutely price information of four Forex cross pairs (EURUSD, EURSEK, USDJPY, and USDMXN), and the daily trading period is \( T = 1440 \) minutes.

## 2.1.1 Weekly Seasonality

Trading volatility is slightly lower on Monday and Tuesday than on other days, and higher on Friday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

## 2.2 Intraday and Interday Auto-correlation

Intraday auto-correlations reflect latency in trading volatility, while interday auto-correlations show daily seasonality of volatility.

---

# 3 Methodology

We build a single neural network to capture all the desired empirical characteristics of volatility by designing modules for each empirical pattern and integrating them.

We aim to predict the next minutely log range of a currency pair using information up to time \( t \) on day \( D \), adopting a standard regression setting. We use the squared loss function to optimize the model parameters.

We discuss input \( X_t^D \), model architecture \( f \), and build a unified neural network to capture the empirical patterns.

## 3.1 DNN and Time-based Patterns

To predict trading volatility, we consider the timestamp \( t \), day of the week \( t_D \), and month \( t_D \) as input factors, using a multi-layer artificial neural network (DNN) to learn the next minutely volatility.

## 3.2 LSTM and Auto-correlations

We use the lagged values of log range in the previous \( p_t \) minutes and \( p_d \) days as the input \( y_t^D \) and \( z_t^D \) respectively.

The LSTM model, known for its strength in analyzing sequential data, is used to predict the log range.

## 3.3 2-LSTM and Multi-scale Time Dependence

To capture both seasonality of the volatility simultaneously, we propose the multi-scale LSTM model (2-LSTM). It applies two LSTM models to \( y_t^D \) and \( z_t^D \), then applies the \( l \)-layer DNN to the concatenated output.

## 3.4 p-Pairs-learning 2-LSTM and Cross-currency Pair Correlations

We propose a 2-LSTM model to predict the volatility of \( p \) currency pairs by coupling information from non-liquid pairs with more liquid pairs that share the same currency base.

The p-Pairs-learning 2-LSTM model uses historical information from other pairs sharing the same currency base to capture cross-currency pair correlations.

# 4 Numerical Results

We compare the predictive performance of deep learning-based models with two traditional autoregressive models. We choose the optimal orders \( p \) for EURUSD, EURSEK, USDJPY, and USDMXN based on results shown in Figure 10 of Appendix B.

We conduct 3-fold sequential blocked cross-validation in chronological order, using mean squared error (MSE) as the test metric. We also perform a statistical test called the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test.

## 4.1 Network Architecture

The proposed p-Pairs-learning 2-LSTM method consistently outperforms other models in terms of MSE on testing sets. LSTM-based methods noticeably reduce MSE compared to plain DNN by incorporating historical volatility information.

In Table 3 of pairwise DM test results, we observe that 2-LSTM and 2-Pairs-learning outperform other methods for EURUSD, EURSEK, USDJPY, and USDMXN, while 4-Pairs-learning has statistically similar performance to other models.

## 4.3 Comparison Between LSTM-based Models

The 2-LSTM model, using intraday historical data and a recurrent structure, shows significant improvement over LSTMD, though it doesn't significantly outperform LSTMt.

For 2-Pairs learning, the prediction results improve slightly for less liquid currencies. For 4-Pairs learning, the results are significantly boosted compared to 2-Pairs learning when considering MSE averages.

## 4.4 Sensitivity Analysis

We study the sensitivity of 4-Pairs-learning 2-LSTM to lag value \( p \). The MSE on testing data decreases as \( p \) increases.

# 5 Conclusion

We developed deep learning-based models to forecast intraday volatility in the Forex market. The proposed model consistently outperforms conventional methods and other deep learning models in terms of MSE and DM test results.

## A.1 Supervised Learning Framework

Supervised learning aims to find the optimal parameters for a continuous map between input and output, such that the predicted output is as close as possible to the actual output.

Cross entropy loss is popular for classification, while mean squared error (MSE) is used for regression problems.

## A.2.1 Deep Neural Network

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are multi-layer networks with \( L > 2 \), defined recursively using an activation function, weight matrix, and bias term.

## A.2.2 Long Short-Term Memory

LSTM consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Each memory cell has three gates: input, output, and forget.

We compute the MSE of AR(\( p \)) models for different currency pairs using the LSTM model.
